= Page Group Permissions

Created by Matt Freels

This extension allows you to organize your users into groups and divide up site-editing privileges accordingly. It requires Radiant 0.6.5+ and the Shards extension found in the official Radiant repository.

To install, add page_group_permissions to vendor/extensions, and run:

rake db:migrate:extensions
rake radiant:extensions:page_group_permissions:update

Basic Usage:

Create and edit groups and add/remove members from the new groups tag.
Add page to a group by editing the page.
A member of a group has permission to edit any page owned by the group or children of said pages.

Enjoy!
